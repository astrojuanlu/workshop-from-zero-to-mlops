I have a coworker, Loopy (31) who has worked at the company with me for the same time - we are part of the same team and no one has a higher position than the other one. We previously worked together at another company, where I was a project manager and had to fix their mistakes and the owner would come to me to ask me to redo what they had done. Currently, they tends to micromanage my work, even though they lack expertise in my field. Despite attempts to resolve issues directly, Loopy's unprofessional conduct continues.\\n\\nThe problems include delays in workflow, where their involvement in every detail of projects leads to unnecessary delays. Projects that take me little time to do are held up for days due to their slow feedback. A lot of things had to be rushed or were not launched at all because they took too long. This is a consistent issue, happening with nearly every project and minor detail since they want to be involved in everything.\\n\\nAdditionally, Loopy often claims credit for work I’ve done, telling others they contributed significantly when they only provided negative feedback. For example, she has told our boss that they talked to clients or created documents that were entirely my work. They misrepresented accomplishments in a letter to our boss claiming they achieved things I did. In meetings, they frequently diminishe my individual contributions by presenting them as collaborative efforts, while taking full credit for their own work and not even mention my big contributions to them. I feel they just want to review everything to put their stamp on it and make it seem they contributed more than they did.\\n\\nLoopy's conduct include gossiping about colleagues and speaking negatively about our boss. They have called another coworker “bitchy” and “bossy,” and has said our boss doesn't know what he is talking about and that the services the company offer are imposible to sell because the services are bad. They have also created a hostile environment by being dismissive of my feedback and making me feel discouraged from voicing professional opinions. For instance, when I provide feedback or disagree with their ideas, they responds with hostility and does whatever they want without taking my experienced opinion, making collaboration difficult.\\n\\nFurthermore, they have deliberately excluded me from participating in events or special out of office activities. These exclusions are deliberate and not a simple oversight and I know it because they broadcasted the invitation to everyone except me. Their behavior has made it challenging to maintain a positive work environment.\\n\\nThe last drop was when they called me unprofessional. Something exploded in me after that and I have now reported all of these issues to my boss in a detailed letter. Nothing came from it really, but I feel that is because the boss don't have time. At the end of the day, he has a company to run; however, I think Loopy was told something because afterwards, they confronted me angrily, accusing me of trying to undermine them and minimize their contributions. I sincerely think they are afraid I take their job or that I stall their growth in the company which is outrageous because I don't want to do that and I don't really care about anything else but my own growth and contributions. Since then the process has changed a little and now I do not wait for Loopy's revision or feedback before I go to the final decision maker directly. They definitely are not okay with this and they have stopped speaking to me. This also includes not replying to the emails I send to them AND the boss for feedback or approval. Also another thing that happened recently is that I was trying to start a new project and asked them if a meeting with them and the boss ti what they replied that they didn't care about my opinions and why would I ask them anything if I am still going to do whatever I want.\\n\\nAt the end of the day is not that I dont want feedback, is that I don't think there should be these many layers between me and the final approver.\\n\\nLoopy's behavior created a toxic work environment for a while, making me not care about anything that had to do with the company. I am usually a person that voices their opinions and I am always happy to work as a team and not being able to do so just because I just wanted to not make them angry put a weight on me and I started feeling unhappy, depressed and wanting to quit because I felt I had no growth opportunities in the company. Their behavior had been like that for months and I did make an attempts to address issues directly and diplomatically, but their behavior persisted.\\n\\nAnyway, I guess I just wanted to vent a little and ask the Redditors on this board - AITA for reporting their behavior? Should I have done something differently? And what should I do now?\", flair_text='TL;DR'),\n",

She’s the youngest and I’m the oldest (three girls in total!) all three of us are very close, often FaceTiming 4-6 times a day and sharing a lot of our lives with each other. We’ve gotten into arguments before because I have always felt she was a mean person (I.e., always wanting others to do for her but not wanting to reciprocate, easily irritated and often quick to talk down about others not like her, complaining a lot, talking to people in very rude ways). She feels that I am too sensitive and take everything personally. The basis of this blowout is below:\\n\\nI invited my partner to my mom’s place with my mom’s permission and he would stay the night as he was driving 4 hours to come for the 4th of July. When I told my sister she got super irritated and told me she didn’t like that I invited him. I was put off, but I didn’t really say anything initially. The rest of the day went on but it was clear she was upset. Later on that night, I asked her directly if she was upset with me. \\n\\nAt first she said “no I’m just tired” and then launched into saying that it was wrong of me to invite my partner over to stay the night without checking with her to see if she was comfortable with him staying. She also said she’s been annoyed because I kept bringing him up in conversations for no reason and felt that I was “forcing him on them”. I apologized for this and acknowledged that I should have checked with everyone before assuming they’d be cool with him in the house. I told her I only talked about him because I liked him and was happy with him and wanted to share in that with my siblings but if she wasn’t okay with that I’d stop. She got upset and felt I was being condescending and said “there’s a lot I could say but I’m not going to, it’s your relationship, so I don’t care”.  I said that she always says there’s more she could say and asked her to explain what she means by that. She then got more upset and told me to leave her alone. \\n\\nHere’s where I may be the ahole: I said “okay, I’ll leave you alone since you clearly need to be left alone”. I was frustrated with her and snapped a little bit. This comment apparently made her “black out” and she started yelling at me, calling me sensitive, saying this is why she doesn’t talk to me and why she doesn’t like me, and I told her that she’s mean and evil and I don’t like her either so we don’t have to talk at all anymore. Words were exchanged. I hit below the belt by telling her that the reason all of her friendships and relationships have ended is because she’s mean and makes everything about herself. She called me a fat a** b*tch and told me she hated me. \\n\\nI have apologized for my comments as I knew it was hurtful. She apologized too but insists that she blacked out, didn’t remember what she said, and only reacted that way because I “egged her on” with my passive aggressive comment.

I\\'m unsure if it\\'s due to immaturity (he\\'s a few years younger than me) or the fact that he might be harbouring a small crush but he\\'s been doing these small things that have built up over time and have made me come to resent him quite a bit.\\n\\nFor example, he told me infront of me and roughly 12 other people that his cousin could imagine me in a 🌽 video. This made me and his cousin visibly uncomfortable, with his cousin looking mad and imitately denying it and me telling him that that pretty disrespectful. He went of to tell the rest of us that his cousin was lying and he did say that whist hysterically laughing about what he said, (Thinking about him doing this makes me really mad and uncomfortable even now).\\n\\nHe also plays video games with me but likes to egg another friend of ours on to hold meaningless information from me that doesn\\'t need to be held.

These things have happened infront of our friends which I don\\'t think they\\'ve noticed.\\n\\nAnd whilst we were playing i had alot of particularly rare items and he decided to push me into a thing that kills alot of players while laughing as I freaked out.
